    <p>
      Saturn give you access to option data and helps analyze returns for different strategies involving options (see <a
        href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Options_strategies">http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Options_strategies</a>). The strategies are listed
      in the top bar. Saturn computes the return for each of the strategies for the entire market. The results are presented in a table
      where you can easily search, sort and filter results.
    </p>
    <h2 id="general-usage">General Usage</h2>
    <p>Saturn make it easy to analyze what stock give what kind of return for a given strategy. To achieve this, Saturn calculates
      returns for each of the strategies for each of the listed options on CBOE. The results are presented in a table where you can easily
      search, sort and filter them.</p>
    <h3 id="search">Search</h3>
    <p>You can search by typing text in the search box. The input text is broken up into space delimited tokens and all columns are
      searched for each token. Here are a few sample searches you can try.</p>
    <p>
      <code>TSLA 2015-04-24</code>
      Serach for Tesla options expiring 2015-04-24
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>TSLA 2015-04-24 1.67</code>
      Serach for Tesla options expiring 2015-04-24 with any column having the string 1.67
    </p>
    <h3 id="filters">Filters</h3>
    <p>Saturn creates filters (left sidebar) for each of the numeric columns. You can filter by minimum and maximum value. Saturn
      ignores any blank filter boxes.</p>
    <h3 id="other-features">Other features</h3>

    <h2 id="options">Options</h2>
    <p>This view shows raw calls and puts expiring over the next 2 weeks.</p>
    <h2 id="covered-calls">Covered calls</h2>
    <p>In the covered call strategy, you buy the underlying stock and sell an in the money call. In the event that the stock price is
      above the strike at expiry, the stock gets assigned and you keep the profit.</p>
    <p>Saturn calculates return (ROI) and the Protect percentage for all listed options for the covered call strategy. The ROI is the
      return you make if the call gets assigned and protect pergentage is the amount the stock can drop for you to make zero return
      (disregarding trading costs).</p>
    <p>In general, making the same return with the greater protection is better. You can analyze this in saturn by filtering on minimum
      ROI, searching for the expiry and sorting on the protect%..</p>

    </p>
    <h2 id="short-puts">Short Puts</h2>
    <p>Short Puts are equivalent to the covered call strategy and the calculations that saturn does are very similar. Short puts allow
      you to get the same return as covered calls but with only one option trade (instead of an option and a stock in covered call). With
      short puts, there is also no investment up front.</p>

    </p>
    <h2 id="butterfly">Butterfly</h2>
    <p>The butterfly strategy is a pure option strategy. It involves buying a low and a high call and selling 2 mid calls (eg: Buy 170
      and 180 call and sell two 175 calls). Profit is maximum if the stock price at expiry is the mid call price.</p>
    <p>Saturn calculates the butterfly returns for all options within 15% of the current stock price. The low, mid and high prices are
      displayed as well as the setup cost and the maximum ROI. The Zero% column shows how much the stock has to move for you to make zero
      return. If the stock moves ore that than percentage, this strategy will lose money.</p>
